                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Hilltoppers Adventures was founded in 2011 by a group of outdoor educators who believed that every young person deserves the opportunity to experience the transformative power of nature.</p>
                        <p>What started as weekend hiking trips for a handful of local youth has grown into a comprehensive outdoor education program serving hundreds of young people each year across multiple activities and seasons.</p>
                        <p>Today, we continue our commitment to making outdoor adventure accessible to all youth, regardless of background or financial circumstances, while building the skills and confidence they need to become lifelong outdoor enthusiasts.</p>
